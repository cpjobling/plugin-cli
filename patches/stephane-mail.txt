Hi Chris,

thank you for the cli pluging. It is quite useful indeed for documenting screen captures.

I have a number of comments and suggestions of enhancement for it (please see attach). Please let me know what you think about
them:

- the style for "pre.cli" hardcodes the font family, height,
  background color, which may be different from what the <code>
  or <file> tags use. Why not use the same attribute as those?
  That would simply mean removing the pre.cli definition from
  the css file
- Using <cli prompt='whatever'> doesn't work because it is
  stored in that case in $match[2]
- <pre class='cli'> should be spelled <pre class="cli"> to be
  xhtml conformant I believe.
- in
  <cli>
  foo

  bar
  </cli>
  an empty line was added at the bottom and at the top, and the
  middle one was removed. And there were some extra spaces
  added.
- because we're in <pre>, <br/> can be replaces with real line
  separators which makes the HTML source more legible.
- there were some code indentation issues.

I attach 2 patches that fix those /issues/.

The first one allows: <cli prompt="\"foo">, <cli prompt=a\ b>, <cli prompt='a \' b'> but as it makes the matching regexp quite complicated which might slow down the whole dokuwiki, I suggest a simple one that only allows: <cli prompt="..."> (but also <cli prompt="\""> which should allow one to specify any prompt.

Please let me know what you think and whether you'd like me to update the dokuwiki web site.

kind regards,
Stephane
